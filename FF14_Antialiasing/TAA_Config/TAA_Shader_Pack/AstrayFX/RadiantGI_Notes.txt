I do hope I made this shader easy as I can to use. It should be a solo file with no external folders or textures. 
Everything thats is needed for GI alone is in this shader file called RadiantGI.fx

PBGI_Alpha should always be on top of PBGI_Beta at all times.

PBGI_Alpha is the GI Ray Generator.
                                      You can slide any shader between them ;).
PBGI_Beta is what used to apply GI.

PBGI area is what you used to adjust Rays and how they apply to the screen.
			  
Image area is what you used to adjust RadiantGI image output.

Image area is what you used to adjust RadiantGI image output.

Depth Map area is what you used to adjust Depth Buffer for this shader

Extra Options is used for debuffing the information above.
